                <h1 id="newsTitle">New Database Servers</h1>
                <p class="mainText">On January 16 2022, our system has expanded greatly 
                    thanks to the implementation of new Amazon EC2 servers. With this, 
                    continuous data sync with resources, learning materials, auto-syncing 
                    cloud data, etc. has become much easier and faster.
                    It took us a long time to figure out a way to manually do the state 
                    synchronization on the same VM, without having to constantly make 
                    time-consuming CPU or disk IO queries to the database servers. It's no 
                    longer a problem, thanks to EBS snapshots, that's why we call it Auto-sync to EC2!
                    <br><br>
                    Hopefully, after this success, we will be able to develop and improve 
                    another phase of the next step of our technological departments such as 
                    School of Computer Science.</p>

            <p class="mainText">Our early testing resulted in significant changes. 
                Data proves that our sync latency with its Asia servers are no more 
                than 32ms, and 85ms at West Europe servers (measured at Jakarta Head Quarters). 
                This provides us with more motivation to excell and develop new features to 
                provide for students.
                <br><br>
                It’s ready for end-user testing, but we’re going to wait until it’s time 
                to start promoting it to the world before we start showing it to the public. 
                We expect this to become availble for students starting late June, which will 
                come in new features and a whole new study system. We’ll keep you posted.</p>
